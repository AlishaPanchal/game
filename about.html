          <p>
            Hello viewer! This is Alisha Panchal, creator of ________. Welcome! 
            I hope you enjoy this game, but for now, here's a little something about me.
              <ul>
                <li>Personality: Weirder than weird, total bookworm and goody-two-shoes, is 100% a nightowl through and through,
                and is the one kid that "loves school" and studies 24/7.</li>
                <li>Likes & Dislikes: Total bookworm = Loves reading and books (The physical copies, not the wretched "e-books"), 
                loves studying (It keeps me busy, don't come at me), likes playing the violin even though the struggle is real, 
                loves the summer even though is a spring baby (June 4th is close enough), is the most competitive person known to man,
                wants to sleep all day, every day. <br></br>
                Hates HATES HATES the cold and everything remotely close, 
                gets red in the face when people open the microwave before the timer can go off (People, if you can't wait, just hit the "Clear" button!), 
                dislikes lazy people even though wakes up years after the sun rises every weekend.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition to the "About Me", here's my definition of a game is! <br></br>
           Game: A "game" is an object (Collection of objects), a way to play, or a physical activity used to entertain people and/or animals (Themselves or others),
           individually or as a group.

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Gamer Type & Favorite Games</h2>
           <p>My gamer type is KAES, Killer, Achiever, Explorer, and Socializer. I'm an 80% Killer, 60% Achiever, 47% Explorer, and 13% Socializer, 
               and if I'm being completely honest, this is very accurate. I'm an introvert in real life and only babble to my closest of friends, so it makes 
               sense for Socializer to be the lowest. For Explorer, it really depends on the game and what the worldbuilding is about. I like exploring, 
               but after some time, it gets boring. Now onto the spicy stuff. Achiever, yes, yes, and yes. I am a very big Achiever, both in games and in real life.
               As I've said before, I'm the "goody-two-shoes" at school, so getting a 99 on anything is extremely painful because it's 1 point under perfection. 
               In games, similar things happen. Take for example, the Google Doodle Championship Games. There are trophies in that game for helping out other characters, 
               right? What I've done every time I've played that game is get all of the trophies, for both the minigames and for the interactions with the characters, 
               and constantly check the trophy room with the suspicious bird to see if all of the trophies are there. The sense of satisfaction after seeing every single
               golden, glowering trophy in its spot is euphoric. Finally, the best one of them all: Killer. I'm honestly surprised that I'm only at 80%. 
               I think the best example of me being in pure Killer mode is when I'm playing the Teams Mode in paper.io 2. Once I'm in a select team with my music 
               playing in the background, I am in the zone. I don't care about increasing my team's dominance on the map, except for when I need to grow to induce 
               a fight with a new enemy team. Seeing the kill count just going up after each bot kill is so purifying and satisfying that all of my anger just dissipates. 
               Actually, very recently (From the date I'm writing this, 1/26/23), I reached my highest kill score yet, 54. I spent about 45 minutes 
               on that one game and I was on a pure killing streak. Enemy teams were dying left and right as soon as I saw them eating away at my team in the small map 
               in the corner of my screen. It's very therapeutic. <br></br>
               Moving on from the Gamer Types, here's some of my favorite games and why!
                 <ol>
                     <li>Monopoly: I just like buying properties. I prefer the Here and Now Edition, it has an actual ending, which is when a player's 
                     passport fills up to the drawn line (Each property comes with a token). There's something about the trading, swapping, Chance cards,
                     Here and Now cards, etc. that is very nostalgic to me. I also played this very often with my family and neighborhoood friends 
                     when I was younger, so there are a lot of memories connected to this game.</li>
                     <li>Scrabble: I play this game for 2 reasons - 1) To try and beat my mother, who is extraordinarily good at this game, and 
                     2) because my vocabulary is weaker than Mercury's gravity. So there's the drive of competition and academic improvement 
                     that stems from my playing of this game.</li>
                     <li>Paper.io 2 (Teams Mode): This game is purely for me to rage and bring out my inner Killer Gamer Type. 
                     This is also the perfect way to put an evil smile on my face.</li>
                     <li>Sweep: This game is a card game, one that has been played in my family for generations. The rules online are a little different 
                     from how my parents have taught me, but the essential root of the game is the same. I'm not going to explain the game here, but 
                     it's a game of skill, strategy, and the brain. I love strategy games like this and when my parents and I play, it's always a race 
                     to beat my father.</li>
                     <li>Solitaire (Patience): Last but not least is Solitaire. This game I play just to see if I can win and to pass the time when 
                     I'm extremely bored and lonely. Just sitting on my bed with the cards set out in front of me and my music playing in the background 
                     is very relaxing. Unforntunately, this game is not very time-consuming, so I'm left bored once again after a few rounds.</li>
                 </ol>
           </p>
           <p>
              There are many more games that I enjoy playing, but these are the top 5 that come to mind. Thank you for listening to me babble about myself 
              and I hope you enjoy _________! <br></br>
              Sincerely,<br></br>
