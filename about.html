          <p>
            Hello viewer! This is Alisha Panchal, the creator of the game, ________. Welcome! 
            I hope you enjoy this game, but for now, here's a little something about me.
              <ul>
                <li>Personality: Weirder than weird, total bookworm and goody-two-shoes, is 100% a nightowl through and through,
                and is the one kid that "loves school" and studies 24/7.</li>
                <li>Likes & Dislikes: Total bookworm = Loves reading and books (The physical copies, not the wretched "e-books"), 
                loves studying (It keeps me busy, don't come at me), likes playing the violin even though the struggle is real, 
                loves the summer even though is a spring baby (June 4th is close enough), is the most competitive person known to man,
                wants to sleep all day, every day. 
                Hates HATES HATES the cold and everything remotely close, 
                gets red in the face when people open the microwave before the timer can go off (People, you can't wait, just hit the "Clear" button!), 
                dislikes lazy people even though wakes up years after the sun rises every weekend.</li>
              </ul>
           In addition to the "About Me", here's my definition of a game is! <br></br>
           Game: A "game" is an object (Collection of objects), a way to play, or a physical activity used to entertain people and/or animals (Themselves or others),
           individually or as a group.
