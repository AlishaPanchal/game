        <p>
        In this exploration, our team created a board game with characters, rules, a theme, etc. from scratch.
        The step-by-step process we followed is written below. <br></br>
        Step #1: First, our team decided on the pattern for our board,
        which can be seen in Figure 1 below.
        </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Board_Game_Pattern.png" alt="Figure 1" width="500" height="650">

            </figure>
        <p>
        Step #2: Next, we began with our Mechanic Design, specifically our player pieces,
        assets, and interactivity. In our case, the setup has player pieces and assets.
        The multi-colored cubes are the supplies or supply towers, where each of the 5 towers has 3 supplies.
        The multi-colored characters are the player pieces. The dice are used for player movement, battles, quests, and mini games, which are explained later on.
        On the board, the white squares are where players can move, while the lined area outside of the board is called the Dead Zone.<br></br>
        Step #3: Next, we created our initial rules, as well as the name of our board game, "Operation: Board Battlefield."
        The objective of the game is to collect as many supplies and possible before the enemy takes them all. Each supply regenerates a maximum of 3 times
        and players move by rolling the die.<br></br>
        1) The playersâ€™ first move has to be forward, which can only be unlocked by rolling a 1 or a 6 (Using only one die).
        After the first move, players can move straight, right, or left (NOT DIAGONALLY).
        Players take turns, going clockwise.<br></br>
        2) Our board game appeals to 2 Gamer types, the Killers and Achievers. The first option, Quest, is for the Achievers.
        The second option, Battle, is for the Killers.<br></br>
        a) Quest: Players can move across the board to a supply tower. They must roll a total score, with dice (2), of 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, or 12 to obtain a supply.<br></br>
        b) Battle: Players reach a supply tower and wait for another player to battle; players each roll a dice, 
        whoever rolls the higher number adds their dice points to their collective total score.
        Players must reach exactly 18 points to win the battle. If the player BUSTS (goes over 18), they MUST restart at 0. 
        The winning player gains a supply and moves on to another supply tower.
        They CANNOT stay at the same tower. The losing player respawns at Dead Zone. To reenter the game, the player must roll a 1 or 6 (Using only one die). <br></br>
        Step #4: Next, we came up with a theme that fit the other aspects of our board game. 
        The board is a medieval European battlefield where the players are soldiers fighting to survive by battling for supplies. 
        On the battlefield, the key is to survive the smartest way, which requires strategic and quick thinking, as well as gambits and plays that may be risky, but beneficial. 
        This game requires that and more. Players of the Killer Gamer Type can purposely fight battles with their wins while on the other hand, players of the Achiever Gamer Type can purposely avoid battles and strategically gain supplies.<br></br>
        Step #5: Finally, we had our game tested by another group. We had two types of feedback, one from player classmates outside of our group, and the other from our own teammates. 
        Other players said that the game was the enjoyable, with the only confusing part being the number of dice needed to be rolled at what stage of the game. 
        Our own teammates said that the game may be too complex, as well as lacking a proper theme and worldbuildling as that was not our main focus.<br></br>
        Overall, I believe that our group did a good job of creating a thorough, complex yet simple board game that fit most of the criteria. 
        There was a good mix of clarity, innovation, immersion, flow, and fiero.

    <h2 id = "video", style="text-align:center;">Exploration #2: 2D Video Game</h2>
        <p>
        For the second exploration on game design, we first explored a simple game individually, and then created a game on our own. 
        My game, the Shoot the Fruit game, is a simple game about clicking the fruit on the screen. But, don't get fooled by the red ball! 
        The code for my game is written below, as well as an picture of the game setup (Figure 2).
        </p>
            <pre>
from random import randint
apple = Actor("apple")
redball = Actor("red_ball")
global score
score = 0

def draw():
    screen.clear()
    screen.fill("light blue")
    apple.draw()
    redball.draw()
    screen.draw.text("Score: " + str(score), color = "white", topleft = (20,20))
    
def place_apple():
    apple.x = randint(10, 800)
    apple.y = randint(10, 600)

def place_redball():
    redball.x = randint(10, 800)
    redball.y = randint(10, 600)

place_apple()
place_redball()

def on_mouse_down(pos):
    if apple.collidepoint(pos):
        print("Good shot!")
        place_apple()
        place_redball()
    elif redball.collidepoint(pos):
        print("Not a fruit!")
        place_redball()
        place_apple()
    else:
        print("You missed!")
            </pre>
        <p>
            Explanation: The first chuck of code sets the two characters, the apple and the red ball, the random placement of the characters, and the score. 
            The second chuck of code creates the screen, clearing it, making it a light blue color, drawing on the characters, and then creating the scorekeeping text. The third chuck of code places the apple. 
            This is where the random function from line 1 comes into play. The fourth chuck of code has the same function as the third chuck of code, except this time, it is done for the red ball. 
            Afterward, the two lines of code place the apple and the red ball on the screen at random places. Finally, the last chuck of code runs the actual game by using an if/elif/else statement group. 
            The if statement occurs when the player's mouse clicks on the apple, which results in the text "Good shot!" being printed and the placement of the apple and red ball again. 
            In theory, the score counter should also go up by a certain amount of points. However, due to some reason which I could not resolve, it has been removed from here. 
            But it can be assumed that if the apple is clicked, the score counter will increase by 1 point. 
            Next, the elif statement occurs when the red ball is clicked, which results in the text "Not a fruit!" being printed and once again, the placement of the apple and red ball. 
            Once again, there should be a line of code for the score counter, this time decreasing by a point, but it has been excluded because it led to an error. 
            Finally, the else statement occurs when neither the apple nor the red ball are clicked, but instead, the light blue background is clicked, resulting in the text "You missed!" being printed. 
            Again, the score counter line should be included here, this time setting the score back to 0, but it has been excluded.<br></br>
            One way this game can be improved is by including a game timer, which ends the game after a certain amount of time. The player's goal is to click the apple as many times as possible before the timer runs out. 
            Another way this game can be improved is by adding more fruits, but also more tricks. For example, a pear and a leaf can be added, as well as an orange and a splatter of orange paint, etc. 
            All of these additions would bring more challenges to the game, as well as making it more interesting.
