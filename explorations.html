        <p>
        In this exploration, our team created a board game with characters, rules, a theme, etc. from scratch.
        The step-by-step process we followed is written below. <br></br>
        Step #1: First, our team decided on the pattern for our board,
        which can be seen in Figure 1 below.
        </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Board_Game_Pattern.png" alt="Figure 1" width="500" height="800">

            </figure>
        <p>
        Step #2: Next, we began with our Mechanic Design, specifically our player pieces,
        assets, and interactivity. As shown in Figure 2, the setup has player pieces and assets.
        The multi-colored cubes are the supplies or supply towers, where each of the 5 towers has 3 supplies.
        The multi-colored characters are the player pieces. The dice are used for player movement, battles, quests, and mini games, which are explained later on.
        On the board, the white squares are where players can move, while the lined area outside of the board is called the Dead Zone.<br></br>
        Step #3: Next, we created our initial rules, as well as the name of our board game, "Operation: Board Battlefield."
        The objective of the game is to collect as many supplies and possible before the enemy takes them all. Each supply regenerates a maximum of 3 times
        and players move by rolling the die.<br></br>
        1) The playersâ€™ first move has to be forward, which can only be unlocked by rolling a 1 or a 6 (Using only one die).
        After the first move, players can move straight, right, or left (NOT DIAGONALLY).
        Players take turns, going clockwise.<br></br>
        2) Our board game appeals to 2 Gamer types, the Killers and Achievers. The first option, quest, is for the Achievers.
        The second option, the battle, is for the Killers.<br></br>
        a) Quest: Players can move across the board to a supply tower. They must roll a total score, with dice (2), of 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, or 12 to obtain a supply.<br></br>
        b) Battle: Players reach a supply tower and wait for another player to battle; players each roll a dice, 
        whoever rolls the higher number adds their dice points to their collective total score.
        Players must reach exactly 18 points to win the battle. If the player BUSTS (goes over 18), they MUST restart at 0. 
        The winning player gains a supply and moves on to another supply tower.
        They CANNOT stay at the same tower. The losing player respawns at Dead Zone. To reenter the game, the player must roll a 1 or 6 (Using only one die). <br></br>
        Step #4: Next, we came up with a theme that fit the other aspects of our board game. 
        The board is a medieval European battlefield where the players are soldiers fighting to survive by battling for supplies. 
        On the battlefield, the key is to survive the smartest way, which requires strategic and quick thinking, as well as gambits and plays that may be risky, but beneficial. 
        This game requires that and more. Players of the Killer Gamer Type can purposely fight battles with their wins while on the other hand, players of the Achiever Gamer Type can purposely avoid battles and strategically gain supplies.<br></br>
        Step #5: Finally, we had our game tested by another group. We had two types of feedback, one from player classmates outside of our group, and the other from our own teammates. 
        Other players said that the game was the enjoyable, with the only confusing part being the number of dice needed to be rolled at what stage of the game. 
        Our own teammates said that the game may be too complex, as well as lacking a proper theme and worldbuildling as that was not our main focus.<br></br>
        Overall, I believe that our group did a good job of creating a thorough, complex yet simple board game that fit most of the criteria. 
        There was a good mix of clarity, innovation, immersion, flow, and fiero.
